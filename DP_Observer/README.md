# Observer Pattern Definition

The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. In this pattern, there are two main components:

1. Subject: It is the object that contains a list of dependents (observers) and provides methods to add, remove, or notify observers of any state changes.

2. Observer: It is the interface or abstract class defining the methods that the subjects call to notify the observers of any state changes.
